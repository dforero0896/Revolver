# ======= runtime options ======== #
verbose = True  # True for more informative output statements
debug = True    # True for output checks during reconstruction

# ========== cosmology ============ #
omega_m = 0.307115  # used for reconstruction and to convert redshifts to distances (assumes flat Universe!)

# -----------
# Most users will only use weights with survey data in FITS files
# If for some reason you have survey(-like) data in array format (tracer_file_type = 2 or 3), specify what info is
# present in the file using following flags (FKP, close-pair, missing redshift, total systematics, veto flag,

# voxel void-finding (not necessary for ZOBOV alone)
